A freight train carrying iron ore derailed in a remote area of the Mojave Desert on Monday but there were no injuries, authorities said.

The San Bernardino County Fire Protection District said in a tweet that "numerous" cars derailed but did not give a specific number.

"No current threat to the area," the tweet said.

The derailment site was in the Mojave National Preserve near Kelso Depot, a historic railroad site about 160 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
