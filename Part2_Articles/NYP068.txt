A preschooler opened fire on his 1-year-old brother inside their Texas home Tuesday, according to police.

The 4-year-old boy “found an unsecured pistol” inside their Houston house and unintentionally shot the toddler, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said.

The young child was rushed to the hospital but does not appear to have sustained life-threatening injuries.

The children’s uncle told ABC7 that the gun belonged to a relative who was staying with the family.

A 7-year-old girl was also inside the home at the time of the shooting but was not injured.

Deputies are still investigating the incident.

The shooting comes just two months after a 3-year-old accidentally shot and killed her 4-year-old sister inside the same Texas city.

The two girls had been playing inside a bedroom when the younger sister gained access to a loaded, semi-automatic pistol and fired.
