Crystal clear on Yanks pro
Yogi Berra. Born 1925. St. Louis. Led the Yanks to 10 championships. Multiple MVPs. Hall of Famer. One of baseball’s great catchers.

He left us at 90 and is now in the new doc “It Ain’t Over.”

Yogi’s gone but he ain’t over.

Billy Crystal who loved him and is in Tom Bernard and Michael Barker’s Sony Pictures Classics film told me: “We met in 1978. Although known for malapropisms like ‘I might fade into Bolivia’ instead of ‘oblivion’ Yogi was a good businessman. He had a bowling alley.

“Great player but also a terrific family man. Married to his wife Carmen 60 years. They held hands. She loved him and he loved her.

“And a great friend. Unassuming, charming, genuine, sweetest man I ever met. My birthday he’d call and say, ‘Hope you’re not working too hard.’ Opening night of my Broadway show ‘700 Sundays’ he came to my Tavern on the Green party to say he worried about my working too hard.”

And is Billy Crystal working too hard now?

“I’m waiting on the writers strike about a new series in development. As for Broadway I’m glad I don’t have to look out to see just masks anymore. It was like talking to a whole audience that’s ill. They were all wearing masks.

“I love New York. I was born here in Doctors Hospital which then was across from Gracie Mansion and is now a condo. I’m in good shape, I exercise. Do lots of stuff. Light weights. Cardio for 45 minutes. Tennis. I’m married 53 years and want another 53.

“Look, you keep going, Even when on Broadway if you screw up a line you keep going. I remember in one song where I just ended up humming la la la la when I sang lyrics I wasn’t supposed to sing. I got scared when I came off stage but, listen, it was just another night in New York.”
