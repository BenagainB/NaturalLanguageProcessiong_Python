A driver caused a multi-vehicle crash after stopping on a busy Florida highway to help a turtle cross the road, dashcam footage released by police shows.

The crash, which included a semi-truck, happened Tuesday on US-331 in Walton County, according to the Walton County Sheriff’s Office.

“We all can do better to protect the wildlife and natural inhabitants of our great state,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. “Just preferably not in the middle of the road.”

The sheriff’s office released dashcam footage from a truck involved in a crash, which shows the moment the driver was unable to brake in time as he approached several cars that were stopped ahead.

A gray car cuts the truck off as he tries to avoid hitting another vehicle ahead.

The truck side-swiped the gray car and nearly runs off the right side of the road before cutting back and hitting the side of a black pickup truck.

There were no serious injuries in the incident.

“While no ill intentions were meant, trying to avoid or assist an animal who has made its way onto a busy road can cause you or other drivers life-threatening injuries,” WCSO said.

“So, when you come across this predicament in the future and find yourself asking, ‘to swerve or not to swerve’ or ‘to stop and protect’ we hope the answer will now be an obvious one,” the sheriff’s office said.

Police said the turtle survived and was relocated to a pond where it will hopefully live “happily ever after.”
