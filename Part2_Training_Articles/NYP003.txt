A high school in Texas postponed its graduation after the vast majority of the class failed to earn their diplomas.

Just five of the 33 senior students at Marlin High School near Waco, Tex., met the requirements for commencement, with grades or attendance issues dooming most students, KWTX-TV reported.

The school said it planned to reschedule the graduation for sometime in June so students would have more time to qualify, according to a statement posted to Facebook.

“Our commitment to excellence remains unshaken,” Superintendent Darryl Henson said in the statement.

“We hold firm to our belief that every student in Marlin ISD can and will achieve their potential.”

Henderson also took to Twitter to address the dismal graduation rate.

“Our district will grow from this setback,” Henson said.

“Let this be a lesson learned for all. As we continue to go through our annual graduation audit, it’s our obligation to ensure that all students have met all requirements. Support, accountability, & integrity will remain at the forefront.”

The school had recently moved to a four-day school week in an attempt to reduce absences.

“Our shift to a four-day school week is part of our effort to increase bell-to-bell instruction, increase student engagement during days school is in session, and keep absences from infringing on instructional time,” Nikisha Edwards, Chief Academic Officer, said in the statement.

“We are committed to ensuring these strategic shifts benefit students as intended.
