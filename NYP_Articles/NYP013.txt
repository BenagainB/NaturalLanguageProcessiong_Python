New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin was honored Sunday by the New York State Shields for his continued work in support of law enforcement.

Goodwin, who has consistently written in support of New York’s Finest and been a critic of the state’s controversial criminal justice reforms, was celebrated during an annual breakfast at Villa Barone Manor in the Bronx for his “fair and impartial editorials in support of law enforcement,” said the law enforcement nonprofit, which honors fallen police officers.

The longtime columnist was presented with Eric M. Breindel Integrity in Journalism Award, named for the late Post deputy editor and editorial writer.

“The Shields is a wonderful organization, and watching the awarding of Medals of Valor to surviving family members was both heartbreaking and inspiring,” Goodwin said Sunday.

“I was humbled to receive the ‘Integrity in Journalism’ award, named after the late Eric Briendel, a Post editorial page editor, and am very proud to be part of the only paper in New York that has the cops’ backs,” he said.

The New York State Shields, founded in 1990, honors police officers killed in the line of duty and celebrates the heroism of active cops.

Sunday’s breakfast banquet was the group’s 31st such event.
